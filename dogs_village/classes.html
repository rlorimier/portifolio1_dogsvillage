			<p>We’re often asked what the most important thing is to know about raising a dog, and our answer is always the same: Start training early!<br>This course has been designed for pups under 6 months of age.
				Over the 4 weeks of this course, you and your pup will learn all about how to share your home together and get you on the right track from the start.
				We will teach you the basics like "sit", "down", "stay", "recall", "lead work" and "leave it" but the most important thing we will show you is how to build the bond between your family and your new pet in a safe and ethical way.
				Our classes will help your puppy develop into a well-mannered and social addition to the family.
				All of our course attendees will be emailed class notes and videos after each class to help with their training at home.
				We use only scientific and welfare-friendly methods of training and our team are always to help by email if you find that you are struggling with any of the training.</p>
			<h4>What you need to bring along to class:</h4>
			<p>All we ask is that you bring along your dog along with their regular collar/harness and lead.
				Please note, we do not allow the use of slip leads, choke chains, prong/pinch collars or e collars in the centre.
				We will provide any equipment needed plus lots of yummy treats. If your dog has special dietary needs please do bring along a portion of their food.
				We ask that you do not feed your dog for at least 2 hours before class is due to start.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>It’s one of the best ways to deeply bond with your dog. It’s great exercise. And it just might be one of the most personally rewarding endeavors of your life.
				As you and your dog develop the skills necessary for each sport, you become a true team in every sense of the word.
				Whether you just train for fun, or actually compete, we guarantee that you’ll feel a sense of pride at seeing your dog in their “happy” place,
				showing off new skills and accomplishing incredible goals — together.<br>
				Suitable for dogs at all ages with basic training and energetic owners.
				Dog agility is a sport where you direct your dog through a pre-set obstacle course within a certain time limit.
				Courses typically have between 14-20 obstacles, which can include tunnels, weave poles, tire jumps, seesaws, and pause tables where the dog must stop for a set amount of time.
				At each trial you and your dog will race around the unique courses designed for that day.
				All of this is done with your dog relying solely on the cues and body language you use to direct them on course.
