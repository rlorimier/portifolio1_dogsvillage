# Dog's Village

    For my Milestone Project 1 on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement course I have created a dog training website.
    This website was develop to people searching for help to train their dogs. On the main page there is a brief explanation about what positive dog training is and the trainers. There is also a page where you can find out more information regarding all types of training offered, a page where you can book your dog's training section and a gallery.

    You can check out the website by clicking [HERE](https://rlorimier.github.io/portifolio1_dogsvillage/)
