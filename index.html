			<h2>What is positive dog training</h2>
			<p>Positive training is not a scientific term.
				You will not find it in any scientific journals, and you will regularly hear it being mischaracterized by those who do not fully understand it.
				In short, positive reinforcement means that if you reward a behavior you like, there is a better chance of that behavior being repeated.
				There are many different terms used to describe positive training techniques: positive reinforcement, reward-based, force-free, and more.
				What proponents of all of these interrelated philosophies have in common is a shared belief that it is much safer, more effective and humane to teach animals using the overarching concept that if you reward a behavior you like, it is more likely that that behavior will be repeated.
				Similarly, if you ignore or redirect a behavior you do not like, it is more likely that incidences of that behavior will decrease.
				Combine these concepts with the awareness that dogs are not wolves trying to dominate us to achieve 'top dog' status, and therefore do not need to be controlled using dominance-based punishment techniques, and you have the recipe for positive training.</p>
